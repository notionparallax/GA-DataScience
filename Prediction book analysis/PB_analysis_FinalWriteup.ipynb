    "A few months ago I did the [data science]() course at [General Assembly]() in Sydney. As a part of the requirements of that course I needed to do a 'project' to give the abstract skills in machine learning some realistic grounding. Since I already had an academic interest in Prediction book I thought that it'd be great to ask them if they'd give me some data to have a look at. Much to my surprise Wesley from [Trike]() (the people who make Prediction Book) got straight back to me with some sanitised data.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Plan/Hypothesis\n",
    "This is probably the biggest thing I learned from the whole process: You should go into this kind of thing with a plan! My hypotheisis was that \"There's lots of data, on a topic that I'm interested in, so there must me something to be learned\". It turns out that this makes it hard for a bunch of reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. I didn't know what to look for. If I'd had a falsifiable hypothesis then I'd be able to develop tests that woudl support or disprove it. As it was I was just endlessly describing the data until I found something that was interesting enough to find out about. \n",
    " 1. Not having a hypothesis also makes it dificult to decide if you are 'done' or not.\n",
    " 1. Having a plan or a hypothesis gives you a domain of machine learning to get your teeth into. This is a bit arbitrary in real life, but as this is essentially a synthetic situation that needs me to demonstrate some ability with a skillset it would have been a lot easier to say \"make a reccomendation system\" because then I could learn all about reccomendation systems and try to make one that worked with my data.\n",

    "Having gone through this, PB are doing a pretty good job! Everything I will reccomend is really a feature request, it is also based ona  lot of speculation and not real user discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that stands out is the number of passive users, people who have never made a prediction or only make judgements on other people's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "[graph here of user activity, label the point when it goes under 100 predictions, and when it goes under 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Descision making calibration is a pretty niche area, so I would imagine that most people who sign up have a vague idea what they are getting into. However the incredibly high proportion of people who fail to make even a single prediction indicates that there is something getting in the way of them getting their calibration adequatly quantified. My guess is that it's blank slate terror. There are social rules amongst PB users about what to leave public, what to make private etc. and as a new user the first prediction is hard to make. I'd suggest a longer sign up process that takes people through a series of curated questions to get a base level of calibration for new users. Ok Cupid does this to great effect, but there might be chalenges in getting questions that can be judged repeatedly without becoming obsolete.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a useful calibration graph I've worked out that you need roughly 100 predictions to be judged. (This is just based on guessing and scribbling, not on data.) Getting people started on a set of questions would put them on track for getting to a useful graph. Using PB has an incredibly big investment of time and attention before the user sees any pay back; anything that can be done to get new users to that point is going to make it more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibration graph is great for intermediate users who have made their first 100 predictions and are happy knowing that if they say 50/50 then really they mean that there's a 60% chance that it won't happen. Users who have a longer history and more predictions would benefit from knowing if their calibration on 60% will happen is better than ther callibraton on 40% won't. If users had enough data points they might even like to see (using something like [crossfilter]()) whether their long term (far mode) predictions are better than their short term ones, or if they are better calibrated in the morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "##and?\n",
    "One meta thing that came out of this is that you should make presentations and summaries of data while you still have it all loaded into your brain! It's taken a lot of effort to understand what the past me was doing when he wrote this code.\n"

    "\n",
    "Prediction book is a service that allows people to record their predictions along with their confidence in these predictions.\n",
    "Explicitly stating, and recording, confidence in a prediction started with meteorologists in Australia in 1906 , but has been explicitly been done by anyone who was making or accepting a bet. If the person was certain that the event would occur then they should be willing to stake their entire worth on it, so if someone isn't willing to do so they are indicating (imperfectly: risk aversion, discounting etc.) their degree of confidence in an event's likelihood to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to have an understanding of one's calibration with regard to prediction confidence. If a well calibrated person has 70% confidence in an event, then over 100 events that they are this confident of happening there should be about 70 of them that happen and 30 that don't. Or in other words, the confidence can be taken to be the likelihood of that event occurring.\n",
    "Problem\n",
    "Their current feedback on prediction calibration is quite limited. It aggregates predictions across the entire time that a user has been with the site. One of the site's key jobs is to train people to be more accurate predictors, so if they improve then their output won't fully reflect this (e.g. if you start off overconfident, then your output will stay overconfident until you become underconfident for a while).\n",
    "\n",
    "What can the data tell us that we didn't already know? How can the data be presented in a way that will make people better calibrated? Are there any lessons about general decision making that we can discover from this set?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data ##\n",

    "## Hypothesis ##\n",
    "[I'm still a bit hazy about the hypothesis] These data can reveal some trends that will be useful in teaching people to make better decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods ##\n",
    "I'd like to do some clustering to see if people fall into different user patterns: prediction outlook (time between now and judgement), time of day prediction made, confidence. Also some general correlations between these factors: are people over confident in the morning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Until I get more into the data I'm not sure what I can find from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business applications ##\n",
    "This might open up more features for the site itself. The insight into how people think might have academic value (I [wrote a thesis about this](http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/?p=509 ) some time ago at university).\n",

The difference between the lines is the window size.
